                    <p> Hi there! I'm Nate Evans. I was born and raised in Dearborn, Michigan, the land of Henry Ford 
                    and the best falafel on Planet Earth. Way back when, I majored in Audio Production before ultimately 
                    switching to a focus on Art History. I've moved around a bit, from Detroit to Chicago, 
                    and finally San Diego, by beloved adopted home. Here in SD I spend my days serving up craft cocktails
                    and locally brewed beer. Whenever I'm not at work, I love exploring all that Southern California has
                    to offer with my wonderful wife Michele.</p>

                    <p>Recently, I've taken up coding and begun the process of learning all I can about web development.
                    I'm excited about the freedom of expression that it offers, as well as the challenge of learning
                    something tottaly unfamiliar. Hopefully with time and effort,
                    I'll master the craft and reach new heights.</p>
